# Microbial Diversity within Lab-Scale Systems vs Natural Ecosystems

Assessing intra-population variation of microbial lineages within lab-scale systems vs complex microbial communities in natural environments. This repository is the main hub for these analyses but also references other repositories where main analyses for specific modules were performed. This repository specifically contains code for performing intra-population diversity analyses of multiple environments, whereas the other repositories are for more specific datasets and analyses.
